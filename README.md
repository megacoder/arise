ARISE
=====

What is this?
-------------

This is just a wrapper script for the awake(1) utility that knows the MAC addresses for my machines.
You may find the technology interesting.

Yes, the hstnames are weird but at least they do not leak and are useless if they do.

How to use it?
--------------

$ arise *hostname*

Thanks for checking.
